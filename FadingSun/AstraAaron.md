Body (Strength, Endurance, Dexterity), and Mind (Wits, Perception, Tech) and Spirit (divided into three opposed pairs (Extrovert/Introvert, Passion/Calm, Faith/Ego). Skills are divided up into Natural Skills, which everyone has, such as Dodge, Impress, Shoot, Observe, Melee, and Sneak and Learned Skills, which you either have or you don't, such as Read, Etiquette, Remedy (medicine), Think Machine (operate computer), Pilot, that sort of thing. All characteristics and skills go from 1 to 10; each of the three pairs of Spirit characteristics have to add up to 10 or less.

To perform an action, you add a characteristic and a skill together to get a goal number. You then try to roll equal to or less than the goal number on a D20. If you get lower than the total, you succeed, and if you get higher than the total you fail. But - and here's the clever bit - the higher you roll, the better. If you match the target number exactly, it's a critical. If you roll a natural 1 it's always an ordinary success; a natural 19 is always an ordinary failure, a natural 20 is always a fumble. If the task is harder or easier, the GM has the option of making the goal number higher (easier) or lower (harder).
